About murasyp
=============
murasyp is Python software for accept/reject statement-based uncertainty modeling.
Or at least, that is what it is going to be.
Currently, murasyp consists of some code for dealing with simpler imprecise probabilistic models: credal sets, sets of almost desirable gambles.
It will be extended to support my (Erik Quaeghebeur's) research.
It is publically available in case somebody else wishes to test it out; feel free to contact me via `my GitHub page <https://github.com/equaeghe>`_ or using the contact details on `my personal website <http://users.ugent.be/~equaeghe>`_.

Currently, murasyp cannot really be installed; it can be tested by installing `Python <http://python.org/>`_ and `pycddlib <http://packages.python.org/pycddlib/>`_, downloading the source with `Git <http://git-scm.com>`_ by running::

    git clone git://github.com/equaeghe/murasyp

and running the `Python <http://python.org/>`_ shell in the source code directory.
Examples of how to use murasyp can be found in this documentation.
You can also browse the source code on GitHub: `equaeghe/murasyp <http://github.com/equaeghe/murasyp>`_.
Note that you need `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to generate the documentation and to run the doctests.

Inspiration for starting this project came from Matthias Troffaes's project `improb <http://packages.python.org/improb/>`_, which is a currently much more developed package for working with imprecise probabilistic models, but with different goals and design choices.
I am also indebted to Matthias Troffaes for getting me started with using `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ and `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.
